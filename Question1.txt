By default, Django signals are executed synchronously, meaning the receiver function runs immediately in the same execution flow.


##code:

import time
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def slow_signal_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal started...")
    time.sleep(5)  # Simulating a delay
    print("Signal finished...")

user = User.objects.create(username="testuser")
print("User creation completed!")



Expected Output:

Signal started...
(Script pauses for 5 seconds)
Signal finished...
User creation completed!
